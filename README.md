# oSTEM Conference Data Visualization & Analysis

**Created at:** oSTEM's National Conference Hackathon 2020 
**Team:** Gouda Gayzz

This is a cleaned up public copy of the project code for Team Gouda Gayzz at oSTEM's national conference hackathon in 2020 so that personal data is not exposed of conference attendees. We created an interactive webpage to help convince sponsors to sponsor oSTEM's national conference by showing interactive data visualizations of past conference demographic and statistical data. 

### Prompt

> "oSTEM would like to create visualizations of our membership data (using the data from members who have opted into the use of their data for analytics) in order to better support our Membership, Conference, and Diversity teams."

Other wants

> ...we would eventually like to use this data to help attract new sponsors and also to find what type of sponsors would be the most interested in our members. 
> ...we would also want to analyze demographic trends over time.  oSTEM is committed to diversity with our membership and at the Annual Conference. To help us understand which communities are well-represented within oSTEM and which communities we need to better serve, we need to understand the composition of our membership and how that has changed over time.
